In mathematics, a power of two is a number of the form  2ⁿ(2의 n승) where 'n' is an integer, 
that is, the result of exponentiation with number two as the base and integer 'n' as the exponent(거듭 제곱). <br>
<br>
In a context where only integers are considered, 'n' is restricted to non-negative values, so we have 1, 2, and 2 multiplied by itself a certain number of times. <br>
<br>
Because 'two' is the base of the binary numeral system, 'powers of two' are common in computer science. <br>
Written in binary, a power of two always has the form 100…000 or 0.00…001, just like a power of ten in the decimal system. <br>
<br>
Two to the power of n, written as 2n, is the number of ways the bits in a binary word of length n can be arranged. <br>
A word, interpreted as an unsigned integer, can represent values from 0 (000…0002) to 2n − 1 (111…1112) inclusively. <br>
Corresponding signed integer values can be positive, negative and zero; see signed number representations. <br>
Either way, one less than a power of two is often the upper bound of an integer in binary computers. <br>
As a consequence, numbers of this form show up frequently in computer software. <br>
<br>
As an example, a video game running on an 8-bit system might limit the score or the number of items the player can hold to 255—the result of using a byte, which is 8 bits long, to store the number, giving a maximum value of 28 − 1 = 255 <br>
